Sure, here's a simple README content for your Streamlit clustering comparison app:

```
# Clustering Comparison: EM vs K-Means

This Streamlit app demonstrates a comparison between two clustering algorithms: K-Means and Expectation-Maximization (EM) using Gaussian Mixture Models.

## Overview

Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique used to group data points based on similarity. In this app, we generate a synthetic dataset and apply K-Means and EM clustering algorithms to identify clusters within the data.

## Features

- Allows the user to adjust the number of clusters using a slider in the sidebar.
- Displays the resulting clusters for both K-Means and EM algorithms.
- Evaluates the clustering performance using the silhouette score, providing insight into the quality of the clusters.

## Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the app using the command `streamlit run clustering_app.py`.
3. Adjust the number of clusters using the slider in the sidebar to observe how the clustering results change.
4. Explore the clusters visually and compare the performance of K-Means and EM algorithms using the silhouette score.

## Requirements

The app requires the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

These dependencies can be installed using pip with the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
