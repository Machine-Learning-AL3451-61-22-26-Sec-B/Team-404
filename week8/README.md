Sure, here's a basic README file content for your Streamlit app:

```
# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier for Iris Dataset

This Streamlit application demonstrates the use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for classifying the Iris dataset.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to predict the species of iris flower based on these features.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Use the sliders in the sidebar to adjust the test size and the number of neighbors (k) for the k-NN algorithm.

5. The app will display the accuracy of the model, the confusion matrix, as well as the correct and wrong predictions.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Numerical computing.
- Streamlit: Web application framework for building interactive web apps.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.
